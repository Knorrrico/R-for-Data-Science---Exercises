```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Exercise Chapter #1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

1. What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue")
  )
```
Answer: The color aesthetic isn't part of aes(). It goes on the outside.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
  )
```
