## Exercise Chapter #1

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### 1. What's gone wrong with this code? Why are the points not blue?

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = "blue")
  )
```
#### Answer: The color aesthetic isn't part of aes(). It goes on the outside.

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy), color = "blue")
  )
```

### 2. Which variables in `mpg` are categorical? 

```{r}
mpg
```


### Which variables are continuous?
### How can you see this information when you run `mpg`?
